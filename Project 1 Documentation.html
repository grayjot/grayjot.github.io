                <h3>Design Process</h3>
                <p>This project was the most challenging coding project I have ever had to endure. 
                    Having never had experience with HTML, javascript, or D3, I began my design process thinking like
                    a minimalist. My first obvious goal was to replicate the original map with its three key elements: 
                    deaths, pumps, and streets. Once I successfully plotted red dots representing deaths and black dots
                    representing pumps, I felt a better sense of agency of what I wanted the final project to look like.
                </p>     
                <p>
                    The map itself is the star of the show. Because of this, I initially wanted it to be very big and flashy. 
                    When I envisioned a recreation of the famous map, I saw it as something that needed to be at least 800 x 800 
                    pixels in the center of the screen. It wasn't until I added some of the auxiliary visualizations that I reconsidered 
                    the presence of the map. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second chart I built was a Deaths by Date line chart--rather, a density chart. I intended it originally to be 
                    a line chart because this is the most universal way of showing a quantitative variable like Deaths trending over a 
                    continuous date range, but somewhat accidentally, my viz filled in black below my red trend line, and it struck me as 
                    somewhat beautiful. Not only that, but it was effective in showing the dense spike in deaths on September 1st. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The red and black density viz inspired me to proceed with this grim, gory theme of red and black. I didn't want any of
                     the colors to be too abrasive or unsettling, but it was a color theme that subtly highlighted this scary sequence of 
                     events in London at the time. Furthermore, it reflected the minimalist approach I originally was aiming for. 
                </p>
                <p> The next two visualizations I created were both simple bar charts: one showing the deaths by gender, and the other 
                    showing deaths by age range. I considered using color as a channel for the two genders, but I decided that it added 
                    hardly any value to the visualization because the viewer could just read "Female" and "Male" on the axis to 
                    differentiate the two. Also, the total deaths for females and males were nearly identical, so there wasn't a need 
                    to contrast the two. For the deaths by age range viz, I proceeded with my minimalist approach and made yet another 
                    black bar chart with the dark red trim. The biggest challenge with this viz was fitting the axis labels on the 
                    x-axis. I ended up rotating the labels, and the result looked rather nice.
                </p>

                <h3>Visualization Layout</h3>
                <p> Once all 4 of my charts were created, I pondered how to best represent them for the viewer. 
                    I came to a realization that I wanted all of the charts to fit on the same screen for the viewer instead of 
                    having the map be very large. The viewer would have to scroll to the other visualizations, and this would be 
                    an inconvenience given that I was hoping to add interaction between the visualizations. The first step I took 
                    was shrinking the size of the map basically in half. Because it then looked too small to read, I added a nifty
                     zoom feature that allows the viewer to magnify the map to read it more clearly. 
                </p>
                <p>After sizing the map, I then had to figure out how the other visualizations would support the map. 
                    I made the decision to put the remaining three visualizations side-by-side in a flex container 
                    that would lie directly below the map. I knew I wanted interaction between my density chart and my map, so 
                    I centered the density chart directly under it. I felt like the other two visualizations were very similar in 
                    design and value, so I didn't have a preference on which of the two fell on either side of the density chart. 
                    Regardless, my vizualization was now finalized and ready to add interaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from tooltips in the two center visualizations, the main interaction I wanted was changing the number of death dots 
                    on the map depending on which day it was. I added a click filter on my density chart. When the viewer clicks a dot 
                    for a particular date, the deaths on the map filter to show only dots that died on that date or prior to that date. 
                    I didn't feel the particular need to filter the dots in this way by age or by gender. 
                </p>

                <h3>Surprising Findings</h3>
                <p>
                    The best part of this project was using my visualizations to learn something new about this data that I didn't 
                    previously notice. Here are some discoveries I found when viewing and interacting with this viz. 
                    <br>
                    <br> 1. There was a clear spike in cholera deaths on a particular day-- September 1st. I would have assumed 
                    the outbreak and deaths would have been a more gradual process, but the water must have become infected in the 
                    central pump on a specific day. 
                    <br> 2. The elderly and children definitely struggled with this illness more than anybody aged 11-80 years old. 
                    I did not have any prior knowledge of cholera and its effects on humans, and I suppose it's surprising that children 
                    were so susceptible to dying from it. 
                    <br> 3. More than anything, this visualization made me wonder more about the distribution of pump use in central 
                    London. Was the central pump the only pump that had cholera-infected water, or did most people just live (and die) 
                    in the central part of town near Broad street? I would love to see a population density map for the downtown area.
